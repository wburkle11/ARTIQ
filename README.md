# ARTIQ

**ARTIQ** (Advanced Real-Time Infrastructure for Quantum Physics)  
___

## Repository Mission Statement 

Quantum experiments implemented in [Richerme Lab](https://iontrap.physics.indiana.edu/) require a control system harmonizing a wide variety of laboratory instrumentation with suffecient accuracy and reliability. There is a software 
and hardware side to our control system that work in tandem with eachother, together they form what we commonly refer to as "ARTIQ". ARTIQ started and remains an open source research effort, founded within the Ion Storage Group at NIST. ARTIQ in very general 
terms is a high-level open-source Python module for real-time control of experimental hardware. 

My absolute largest piece of advice for anyone new to ARTIQ would be to read **Section 3.5** of the following thesis: 

**Trapped Ion Cooling, Heating, and Thermometry - A. J. Rasmusson [(LINK)](https://iontrap.physics.indiana.edu/papers/Rasmusson-Thesis.pdf)**

Not only will reading this give you a substantial introduction to ARTIQ and all of its intricacies, but it is also written at a level that really strengthens your understanding of how to actually *use* ARTIQ without painfully scrolling through the M-Labs documentation and forum posts.

What I aim to do with this GitHub repository is to simply store and keep track of all things related to ARTIQ throughout my time with Richerme Lab. Below, I will keep all generally relevant links that we refer back to time and time again conveniently stored. Within this repository, I will post example code and README documentation over various upgrades and/or modifications we make to our ARTIQ system. ARTIQ can be daunting to say the least, and has quite a learning curve. Getting help from the overarching community has been absolutly critical in our experience as a lab. Hopefully within this repository contain solutions or relevant information to aid a young grad students misery.
